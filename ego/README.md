# Extensible aGent Orchestrator

Ego is an attempt to make an extremely programmable and introspectible agentic orchestration framework. Everything runs off a central Python process, including actions taken by the agent.

Inspired by my favorite editor.

- Shoutout to https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/simple-python-repl/ for a really good tutorial on building repls
- Actual source code: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/code.py
- (via claude) https://rogs.me/2026/02/use-your-claude-max-subscription-as-an-api-with-cliproxyapi/

General idea
- make the repl allow text code generation that can then be implemented by the agent
- do I want it to be a claude replacement or a coding replacement or something else?

options
- full fledged agent orchestrator that runs with python, emacs like extensibility and behavior
  - use the repl support and implementation to make it easier to do things
  - and define functions and build tools ondemand
  - kind of like establishing a smalltalk vm on the fly
  - something that can run in an existing repl and interact with it
  - instrument the code generated by the model to do things, version it and save it
  - keep an eye on memory used
  - persist the conversation live to disk


- first, try proving out the idea of recursive llms / just giving the agent access to python, history, context etc. easily


- thinking through this:
  - there's an interaction window for me
  - there's outputs for all users & agents interacting with the same memory
  - can have multiple frontends, the same way emacs does it
  - need to understand what I can pull off with models
  - AI can work on any layer, which is what makes this so much fun
